# Pure Neural Network in Python

I wrote this NN so I could experience the network functionality directly. This means I did not use any usual library for NNs in Python, such as Keras or Tensorflow. I did, however, use Numpy, which I believe does not defeat the purpose of this task.

Below the functions you should see that there are two tasks available (both commented).

### First: A random network and plots

First generates a random net, with number of layer equal to entries in NS, and layer size is an `int`. You can plot it with the `Plot_2Dnetwork2()`function.

### Second: an OR logic gate using a 2 layer NN

Just follow the written steps to get the following plot:

## Some resulting plots  

It is interesting to see that the network gets better at reproducing the randomness of the inputs as more layers are added, but also smooths them more.
